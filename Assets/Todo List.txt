/* TODO LIST */
High Prio:
	- Find out the max size of a texture atlas
	- Find out how to use multiple texture atlases if more than one is needed

Med Prio:
	- Add in super basic inventory
	- Add in the ability to cut down trees and mine stones
	- Add the ability to modify the terrain
	- Add in ability to build campfire and small shelter
	
Low Prio:
	- Make each tile have its own tile type
	- Add save to disk / Load from disk
	- Implement thermal erosion
	- Implement hydraulic eriosion
	- Make Regenerate work with Chunk Objects
	- Create a few more interesting biomes using the BiomeManager
	- Create a better system for spawning chunk objects
	
Finished:
	- Find out a way to map each tile's UVs to a texture atlas
	- Modify the terrain generation so that it fits a first person perspective
	- Refactor te spawning of trees and towns. ChunkGenerator should handle all that stuff.
	- Make trees combine into single mesh
	


Random thought:

* I need a class that mushes together individual textures into a texture atlas. The AtlasManager could do this. It takes in an array of textures, multiple if multiple atlases are needed, and simply reads the pixels and settings.
 
* I probably need to generate borders around each texture in the atlas. I'll skip that to begin with an implement it if it's really needed.

* I need to set the horrible garbage default mip maps of the generated atlas. To begin with, I'll make my own weird downscale algorithm to do that. Doesn't have to be pretty, just have to work.
